# War Card Game

Welcome to the War Card Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic card game "War" developed in Swift. This project was created following the tutorial series by CodeWithChris on how to make an app in 8 days.

## Game Description

The War Card Game is a two-player card game where each player is dealt an equal number of cards from a standard deck. The objective of the game is to win all the cards.

The game follows these rules:

- The deck is divided equally between the two players.
- Both players simultaneously reveal the top card from their deck.
- The player with the higher-ranked card wins and takes both cards.
- In case of a tie, a "war" is declared.
- During a war, each player places three additional cards face down and then reveals the next card.
- The player with the higher-ranked card wins all the cards in play.
- The game continues until one player has all the cards and is declared the winner.
